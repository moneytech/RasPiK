=======

The idea of this project is really simple :

I would like to learn how to write an ARM kernel for a long time, and, as I had
a Raspberry PI, I thought that write a kernel for it was the best way.

Moreover, I envisage writing the most light micro-kernel, with nothing more that
a GPIO driver, a File System, and a binary execution, to try to drive some
hardware with it then rate perfs.

Use make boot to try it into qemu.

PS : During the developpement, I will make it works only on QEMU, then I'll fix
     everything on real device.
